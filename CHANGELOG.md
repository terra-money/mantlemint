## [v0.1.2](https://github.com/terra-money/mantlemint/tree/v0.1.2) (2022-04-14)

This release contains a depencency upgrade for [core](https://github.com/terra-money/core)@0.5.17...@0.5.18. Apart from the dependency bump all functionalities should be exactly the same as v0.1.1.

You may need to rebuild contracts cache. Referencing from core@0.5.18 [release note](https://github.com/terra-money/core/releases/tag/v0.5.18):

> Release Note
>
> This release contains a wasmer version bump from v2.0.0 to v2.2.1. The wasm caches of these two versions are not compatible, thus rebuilding is required.
>
> To avoid possible sync delays due to the runtime rebuilding overhead, it is highly recommended that node operators rebuild their wasm cache with the [cosmwasm-cache-rebuilder](https://github.com/terra-money/cosmwasm-cache-rebuilder) before replacing terrad runtime to v0.5.18.
>
> Node upgrade instructions
>
> 1. Rebuild your wasm cache using the cosmwasm-cache-rebuilder. This rebuilder can be run simultaneously without killing a running terrad process.
> 2. You can ignore the file already open error. If other errors occur (no disk space, etc), it is safe to run the rebuilder multiple times.
> 3. When the rebuilder is finished, update terrad to v0.5.18 and restart.
> 4. The rebuilder creates a `$TERRA_HOME/data/wasm/cache/modules/v3-wasmer1` directory. The `$TERRA_HOME/data/wasm/cache/modules/v1` can be deleted after updating terrad to v0.5.18.
